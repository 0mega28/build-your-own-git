Codecrafters challenge: ["Build Your Own Git" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/git).

In this challenge, we'll build a small Git implementation that's capable of
initializing a repository, creating commits and cloning a public repository.
Along the way we'll learn about the `.git` directory, Git objects (blobs,
commits, trees etc.), Git's transfer protocols and more.

Implemented 
- git init
- git cat-file -p <sha-hash>
- git hash-object -w <file-path>
